<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Game Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games. It is written on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language. Pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from [python.org](https://python.org)

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
   ```
### Installation


1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cochisealfonso/project.git
   ```
2. Run the game

   ```sh
   python .\project.py
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How to Play


The player only has __one (1)__ bullet to shoot.

The player can move __UP__, __DOWN__, __LEFT__, or __RIGHT__ using `W A S D` keys.

To shoot a bullet, hit the `SPACE BAR`.

The player can only re-shoot a bullet when it either hits an enemy or it reaches the end of the screen.

Each enemy can be killed by a bullet, and every kill is __one (1) point__.

When the enemy reaches the rope, the game ends.
